# Class Contrastive Explanations and Generating Complex Stories from Machine Learning Models

In order to provide a better explanability for machine learning models in healthcare are. We provide an implementation for class contrastive analysis for Pima dataset 
In addition to this approach, Mark W. Craven and Jude W. Shavlik proposed extracting Thee-Structured representations of trained networks in 1993.
We use the Trepan implementation in "Extracting tree-structured representations of trained networks" : Craven,Shavlik 1993 from github user: @abarthakur.

`2D_pima_heatmap.ipynb` does the following things

1. Trains a simple 3-layer neural network on the pima dataset
2. Provides Data centric explanation like outlier detection
3. Provides double feature class contrastive analysis
